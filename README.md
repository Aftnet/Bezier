# Bezier

By [Alberto Fustinoni](http://aftnet.net)

An experiment in calculating and drawing Bezier curves: the program allows manipulation of the displayed curve by clicking on and dragging its control points around in 3D space. To make the program a bit more interesting, an airplane following the curve as its flying path has been added. As usual, the WASD keys are used for movement while looking around entails right clicking and dragging.

The program was also a test of flexibility and portability of the OpenGL framework created for the Terrain Generator.

As was the case for my previous OpenGL effort, the program initialization code is based on Matthew Bettâ€™s framework and all art assets were acquired around the internet.

## Controls
Use the WASD keys to move and look around by right clicking and dragging

## System Requirements
Windows XP or later, a reasonably fast system: Pentium M 1.6 GHz or better, 1+ GB RAM, a DirectX 9.0b grade GPU (Shader Model 2.0) with the latest drivers installed (required as the program uses OpenGL extensions such as VBOs, Vertex and Fragment shaders).
